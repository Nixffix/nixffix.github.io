                        <p>Halo   is a tokenised sci fi strategy game and economic simulation on a galactic scale. Halo is the world’s first science fiction themed “4X” play-to-earn game involving combat, exploration, mining, developing planets, base building, token farming, and trading. All resources such as minerals, and structures such as ships and buildings are mined and created by the players themselves.</p>
                        <p>Halo provides intuitive gameplay intertwined with deep strategy, enabling absolute beginners and crypto veterans to earn real crypto exploring, mining, trading, building, and fighting in a vast galaxy of limitless possibilities.</p>

Buildings cost tokenised resources to build, and different buildings generate different resources daily. They are key to any strategy to maximise resource production and profits for players, providing a reliable income of tokens on a daily basis. For details of the buildings available please see the chapter Buildings [link to chapter] later in this whitepaper. Planets and Asteroids are NFT collections; players will need to own Planets and / or Asteroids to be able to build buildings on them and develop their worlds.</div>

                            <p>In the far future humanity had inexorably spread across the cosmos. This was a time of utopia and peace, trillions lived in paradise on a million worlds . There was no war: everyone lived for a thousand Earth years and pursued their highest calling. Beautiful works of art were created, indeed whole worlds were created as art, and humans were on the verge of discovering the secrets of existence itself. Sentient robots and uplifted apes, wolves, dinosaurs and monkeys did humanity’s bidding.</p>
                            <p>Then came the great collapse. No one was sure how it started, but everyone saw how it ended. All of humanity’s advanced tech became useless in an instant. Trillions perished from famine, disease, and the wars that erupted over the remaining rudimentary resources of each world.</p>
                            <p>A secretive group known as The Guardians had been protecting highly advanced AI tech for thousands of years. Many gave their lives for their sacred mission. Like a phoenix rising from the ashes, to try and restore order in the galaxy The Guardians created the Halo Nexus: a hyperintelligent AI to oversee all technology, all trade, and all resource distribution in the galaxy. Under the ever watchful and omniscient Halo Nexus AI, humanity and their uplifted ape brethren could begin again on their quest to regain their former glory. Will you help them?</p>

                        <div class="media__text">PRESS RELEASE. Combining play-to-earn mechanics with base building, developing planets, trading, staking, missions, colonization, combat, and more, Halo offers players a strategic galactic experience with limitless earning potential</div>
                        <div class="media__text"><span>15 August, 2024, Location</span> — Halo,   is a play-to-earn sci-fi strategy game that focuses heavily on providing its players with a plethora of different ways to earn through the ecosystem’s 15 in-game currencies and the game’s main cryptocurrency, Halo.

                        <div class="media__text"><span>What is Halo?</span></div>
                        <div class="media__text">Halo is a tokenized, sci-fi strategy game set in deep space, with a huge galaxy of realistic planets, asteroids, dyson spheres, ringworlds, ships, and space structures for players to fully immerse themselves in. The game offers players several key gameplay loops, including: staking, planetary development, building structures, resource generation, ship building, missions, exploration, colonization, combat, and in-game trading.

                        <div class="media__text"><span>Exploring the Game</span></div>
                        <div class="media__text">The more ambitious Halo explorers can engage in deep space exploration, combative gameplay in Contested Space, whilst extensively upgrading bases and other structures.</div>
                        <div class="media__text">More casual players looking to earn passively can trade all of the in-game currencies, along with a multitude of in-game items, NFTs, and earn an APY from numerous staking options.</div>
                        <div class="media__text">All Halo ships, resources, structures, and buildings are created by the players, and can be used to forge expansive space empires, mine exotic resources, or take on space colonization missions. Players can earn, mine, trade, or stake Halo’s 15 in-game currencies through playing the game, or using the in-game DEX.</div>
                        <div class="media__text"><span>Ways To Earn</span></div>
                        <div class="media__text">Halo players can choose from a multitude of way to earn, including:</div>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Developing planets and earning a reliable income of the 15 different tokens from different buildings and structures</li>
                            <li>Taking on daring, time-sensitive space missions</li>
                            <li>Exploring Contested Space</li>
                            <li>Trading & developing planets, asteroids, and other structures to sell P2P</li>
                            <li>Soft staking supported external NFTs + specialist NFT collections</li>
                            <li>Trade planets, Asteroids, Ships, & Crew NFTs via Halo Nexus NFT Marketplace</li>
                            <li>Trade Halo on MetaMask or Uniswap [ETH & MATIC]</li>
                            <li>Trade up to 15 in-game currencies on Halo’s native DEX</li>
                            <li>The Halo player referral program</li>
                            <li>Staking all Halo currencies via on-chain liquidity pools</li>
                        </ul>
                        <div class="media__text"><span>Tokenomics</span></div>
                        <div class="media__text">The Halo team is focused on making sure there are enough resources for further development of the game over a long period of time, creating an environment for stability and steady growth for both the game and the Halo community.</div>
                        <div class="media__text">For this reason, there will be no Halo token sale. Instead, 80% of the total supply is locked into the game for players to earn, through various gameplay loops. This emergent economic structure is designed to benefit active players to have a key role in deciding the fate of the game. Players who wish to progress instantly can get a boost by purchasing Halo from DEXs or in the game.</div>
                        <div class="media__text"><span>Early Adopter Rewards</span></div>
                        <div class="media__text">To ensure the 15 in-game currencies remain valuable, all rewards from buildings, missions, and soft staking will be gradually reduced over time. The first reward structure rebalancing will take place 90 days after launch, giving early adopters of Halo the highest rewards that will be available in the game.</div>
                        <div class="media__text"><span>NFTs</span></div>
                        <div class="media__text">In Halo, Planets and Asteroids are player-owned NFTs with changing metadata that reflect players’ buildings, and customization of their worlds. In addition, there are two Halo NFT collections: Crew Member NFTs, and Specialist NFTs — each offering unique benefits for missions and resource generation for their holders. Halo will also support 17 current NFT collections including Aavegotchi, Galactic Apes, Galactic Apes Genesis, Star Wolvez, and many more.</div>
                        <div class="media__text">Players can buy and trade Halo NFTs on the Halo Nexus NFT Marketplace. 10% of all ETH and Matic from all sales of planets, asteroids and crew NFT’s directly from the game will be used to purchase Halo and resource tokens to provide stability to the market. Halo   will launch in Q4, 2024.</div>
                        <div class="media__text">To learn more about Halo please visit the official website, and read The Halo whitepaper.</div>

Players can utilize up to 15 in-game currencies in a multitude of different ways to forge their own unique path to wealth amongst the stars.</div>
                <div class="post__text"><span>Exploring the Game</span></div>
                <div class="post__text">The more ambitious Halo explorers can engage in deep space exploration, combative gameplay in Contested Space, whilst extensively upgrading bases and other structures.</div>
                <div class="post__text">More casual players looking to earn passively can trade all of the in-game currencies, along with a multitude of in-game items, NFTs, and earn an APY from numerous staking options.</div>
                <div class="post__text">All Halo ships, resources, structures, and buildings are created by the players, and can be used to forge expansive space empires, mine exotic resources, or take on space colonization missions.

                <div class="post__text"><span>Ways To Earn</span></div>
                <div class="post__text">Halo players can choose from a multitude of way to earn, including:</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Developing planets and earning a reliable income of the 15 different tokens from different buildings and structures</li>
                    <li>Taking on daring, time-sensitive space missions</li>
                    <li>Exploring Contested Space</li>
                    <li>Trading & developing planets, asteroids, and other structures to sell P2P</li>
                    <li>Soft staking supported external NFTs + specialist NFT collections</li>
                    <li>Trade planets, Asteroids, Ships, & Crew NFTs via Halo Nexus NFT Marketplace</li>

                    <li>Staking all Halo currencies via on-chain liquidity pools</li>

                <div class="post__text">For this reason, there will be no Halo token sale. Instead, 80% of the total supply is locked into the game for players to earn, through various gameplay loops. This emergent economic structure is designed to benefit active players to have a key role in deciding the fate of the game. Players who wish to progress instantly can get a boost by purchasing Halo from DEXs or in the game.</div>
                <div class="post__text"><span>Early Adopter Rewards</span></div>
                <div class="post__text">To ensure the 15 in-game currencies remain valuable, all rewards from buildings, missions, and soft staking will be gradually reduced over time. The first reward structure rebalancing will take place 90 days after launch, giving early adopters of Halo the highest rewards that will be available in the game.</div>
                <div class="post__text"><span>NFTs</span></div>
                <div class="post__text">In Halo, Planets and Asteroids are player-owned NFTs with changing metadata that reflect players’ buildings, and customization of their worlds. In addition, there are two Halo NFT collections: Crew Member NFTs, and Specialist NFTs — each offering unique benefits for missions and resource generation for their holders. Halo will also support 17 current NFT collections including Aavegotchi, Galactic Apes, Galactic Apes Genesis, Star Wolvez, and many more.</div>
                <div class="post__text">Players can buy and trade Halo NFTs on the Halo Nexus NFT Marketplace. 10% of all ETH and Matic from all sales of planets, asteroids and crew NFT’s directly from the game will be used to purchase Halo and resource tokens to provide stability to the market.

                <div class="post__text">On December 15th, we initiated an early RPG reset, creating a fair and fresh start for new players to step into the adventure. This reset levels the playing field, offering everyone an equal chance to earn Halo and gather valuable resource tokens.</div>
                <div class="post__text">Curious about pre-reset rankings? Check out the final leaderboard in the rpg-wipes channel to see how the last chapter ended. And as a nod to this early reset, we’re boosting the rewards for the top 10 players on the leaderboard for this round — because legends deserve their spoils.</div>
                <div class="post__text"><span>Leaderboard Rewards for Season 1:</span></div>
                <ul>
                    <li>1st place: $300 Halo (was $250)</li>
                    <li>2nd place: $200 Halo (was $150)</li>
                    <li>3rd place: $150 Halo (was $100)</li>
                    <li>4th–10th place: $100 Halo each (was $50)</li>
                    <li>Ranks 11–100: 100 Halo, 50 HLMNR, 50 HLORE</li>
                    <li>Ranks 101–500: 50 Halo, 25 HLMNR, 25 HLORE</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="post__text">Rewards will be distributed when the game launches.</div>
                <div class="post__text"><span>RPG Season 2</span></div>
                <div class="post__text">Season 2 of the Halo RPG game will run for 1 month, giving you time to adjust to the new Legacy Points system, while the development team works on the new RPG referral program in the background. Season 2 will end on Jan 15th 2025, but we expect to launch the new ‘weekly’ season format for Season 3, on January 16th. The rewards for Season 2 will be as previously announced in our blog post.</div>
                <div class="post__text"><span>Introducing Legacy Points</span></div>
                <div class="post__text">To enrich the RPG gameplay we have launched a new system that rewards long-term players: Legacy points. Players can now earn Legacy Points, based on their activity, and season performance vs other players. Points are earned from activities like mining, research, and exploration, with the most active and successful players earning the most legacy points.</div>
                <div class="post__text"><span>How Do They Work?</span></div>
                <div class="post__text">Legacy points are stackable, and will not be wiped at the end of each season. You can spend them on upgrades, or wear them as a badge of honor next to your name on the leaderboard.</div>
                <div class="post__text">Players can use the command (/wipe points) to see how many points they will get once the next wipe happens. Legacy points will also determine your final rewards when Halo officially launches! To check how many points you’ll accumulate until the next wipe, visit the rpg-leaderboard⁠.</div>
                <div class="post__text"><span>How To Spend</span></div>
                <div class="post__text">Player can now see how many legacy points that they have and spend them on permanent upgrades in the ⁠legacy-shop. Legacy Points are now the most OP resource in the RPG system as all upgrades bought with this resource are permanent!</div>
                <div class="post__text"><span>The Referral System</span></div>
                <div class="post__text">Our dev team is hard at work to have the new RPG referral system in place for Season 3. Once integrated players will earn additional reward for referring other players to the RPG game, and referrals will also be added to tasks for future Ambassador Program rounds starting in January.</div>
                <div class="post__text"><span>PvP Battles</span></div>
                <div class="post__text">In future updates we will launch PvP battles! These battles will be high-stakes combat, where players can fight to win (or lose) legacy points. More info on this soon.</div>
                <div class="post__text">Start earning legacy points and crypto rewards today by joining the Halo fleet, stationed at the RPG player dock .</div>

                <div class="post__text">We have been working very hard behind the scenes on the main Halo game, and we have many game screenshots and updates to share!</div>
                <div class="post__text">The game development screenshots are below these updates.</div>
                <div class="post__text"><span>Key updates:</span></div>
                <ul>
                    <li>For a number of reasons the main Halo Game will now launch in Q1 2025. Due to high demand we are in talks with a number of incubators, investors, and others regarding partnerships. This will propel Halo to new heights benefiting players and investors alike. It also gives us more time to play test and update the game, ensuring you will have the smoothest gaming experience possible at launch. Finally, it gives the community more time to enjoy the Telegram Tapper game, the Halo Discord RPG, and any other promotions we might launch!</li>
                    <li>New much more futuristic building designs are also being integrated into the main game.</li>
                    <li>We are also working on far more exotic planet maps for you to construct your buildings on, this will greatly enhance immersion and the aesthetic experience of playing in Halo’s unique sci-fi setting.</li>
                    <li>We are also adding 100+ small cut scenes and artworks into key aspects of gameplay for immersion and to provide an edgy, unique sci-fi gaming experience for you to enjoy.</li>
                    <li>The whitelist for the 10,000 Planet NFTs will also open shortly. Planet NFTs are essential to construct buildings on to earn tokens including Halo, and to use as a home base for your galactic adventures. The first rounds of the planet NFT sales will include discounts for early adopters who are on the early whitelist. More updates coming soon!</li>
                    <li>Possible token sale. Due to demand from the community, VCs, and investors alike, we are exploring the possibility of a token sale. All legal aspects are being investigated by our legal team and we will make more announcements soon. Private investors interested in acquiring Halo tokens are encouraged to reach out to the team.</li>
                    <li>Singapore company. Halo is a fully regulated and compliant project registered in Singapore, abiding by all relevant regulations in this emerging fintech hub. This brings even more credibility to Halo, and is also vital for the protection of our community of valued supporters and gamers.</li>
                    <li>Fully doxxed team. Very soon you can expect our fully doxxed team to be added to the whitepaper and the website. This will include some highly experienced team members in key positions.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="post__text">Halo has been inspired by the likes of Eve Online, Stellaris, Masters of Orion, and even the classic Sid Meier game Alpha Centauri; we are aiming for an old school, raw sci-fi vibe. All while expanding your empire, exploring the galaxy, and earning tokens.</div>
                <div class="post__text">The game itself is a labour of love, and the final product will reflect this.</div>

                <div class="post__text">The time has come Halo Explorers! We have received an increasing amount of community interest in joining the Halo star fleet, so we have decided to run a 3-stage Ambassador program to identify the most worthy Halo apes in joining us on this heroic quest — and win a cargo of rare loot at the same time. Stage 1 has now commenced!</div>
                <div class="post__text"><span>What is the Ambassador Program?</span></div>
                <div class="post__text">The program has been designed to encourage the bravest captains to step forward and engage with our community across all social media platforms, (X, Discord) devise creative ways to get the Halo name out there (through Tweets, Reddit posts, memes, gifs, videos), and get the word out across the galaxy though their Discord referrals links.</div>
                <div class="post__text"><span>How is it Judged?</span></div>
                <div class="post__text">Participants will be judged by their completion of all the tasks available through the Halo Ambassador Program’s points system. There will be an array of prizes and exotic Halo token rewards for the top 10 participants (by way of points total) following the completion of stage 1.</div>
                <div class="post__text"><span>Ambassador Role</span></div>
                <div class="post__text">The winner of each stage of the program will be guaranteed a prestigious ambassador role within the Halo team. In addition to that honor, the winner will receive:</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>$1,000 in Halo, plus an extremely rare Legendary Crew NFT!</li>
                    <li>A custom role name in the Halo TG Group & Discord server</li>
                    <li>Direct comms with our team in the Ambassador Chat Discord channel</li>
                    <li>Advance testing of game demos and new game features before the public</li>
                    <li>A first look at game trailers before release</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="post__text">It is not all about the prizes though, our Ambassadors will become a valued part of our team, providing us with feedback on the game, aspects of the project, and offering their thoughts on future mission possibilities. With this in mind we are looking for quality over quality, so those who don’t win 1st place but still impress us may be considered for a role within the project later on!</div>
                <div class="post__text"><span>Top 10 To Win Prizes</span></div>
                <div class="post__text">We will also be awarding a selection of prizes to the top 10 participants of the program, based on their total points as the end of stage 1. These include Halo tokens, NFTs, and other perks such as custom role names and more. 2nd and 3rd place participants will receive a custom role name in the Halo TG Group & Discord server, a rare Crew NFT, plus $500, and $250 in Halo respectively.</div>

                <div class="post__text"><span>How to Register</span></div>
                <div class="post__text">To be eligible for participation just fill out the program form, and then you can begin your missions immediately!</div>
                <div class="post__text">The First stage of the Ambassador Program is live NOW and will end at 5 pm EST, 16/9/24.</div>

                <div class="post__text">Halo is short for ‘ HALO’ for a good reason! There are no less than 15 different in-game, on-chain currencies, and as many 10 different ways for avid explorers to earn, and grow their empires to hyper-futuristic levels.</div>
                <div class="post__text">Halo’s game economy has been developed specifically for long-term sustainability, offering players different paths to riches based on their own play styles and goals within this expansive multi-planetary environment.</div>
                <div class="post__text"><span>Top Earning Strategies</span></div>
                <div class="post__text">Halo offers a multitude of innovative avenues to amass wealth, converting your gaming experience into strategic plans for domination. Whether you thrive on the adrenaline of space conquest, or prefer to navigate a calculated course, the options available are as diverse as the galaxies you’ll explore. Let’s break down the key earning strategies you can use to get ahead in the game.</div>
                <div class="post__text">Income From Developed Planets — Developing planets and constructing buildings is the core way to generate income in Halo. By expanding your empire, you can earn passively from the resources produced by your developed assets. Buildings on planets can also be upgraded to level 10 and earn you serious amounts of tokens. The more planets you own, and the more buildings you have, the more you will earn every day.</div>
                <div class="post__text">Missions and Resource Gathering — One of the core ways to earn in Halo is by sending your ships and NFTs on missions. These missions are designed to gather valuable resources that can be used or traded for other assets. Think of it as sending your crew on treasure hunts across the galaxy.</div>
                <div class="post__text">Contested Space PvP Invasions — Once the Contested Space update launches, there will be a zone of space where all planets can be developed for earnings like usual, but can then also be invaded by other players! This will lead to intergalactic warfare and an Eve Online kind of experience with many alliances forming to battle over the planets and their token earnings. Fleets of ships can also engage in ship to ship combat, which is necessary to clear the way before a ground invasion. NFT planets are always safe, the planets in Contested Space that players fight over are not NFTs.</div>
                <div class="post__text">Referral Program — Halo’s referral program is a no-brainer for those who love sharing great finds. Invite others to join the adventure, and you’ll receive 1% of the resources they earn for an entire year.</div>
                <div class="post__text">Trading Developed Assets — In Halo, highly developed planets and asteroids can be sold at a premium. Savvy traders can make substantial gains by upgrading their assets and selling them on the open market.</div>
                <div class="post__text">Halo Nexus NFT Marketplace — Speaking of which, the Halo Nexus NFT Marketplace is your go-to platform for trading planets, asteroids, ships, and crew NFTs. Market fluctuations based on supply and demand create ample opportunities for skilled traders to make profits.</div>
                <div class="post__text">Trading Halo Tokens — Halo tokens can be traded on supported decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on the Ethereum and Polygon networks. This provides another avenue for earning within the game.</div>
                <div class="post__text">Exploring Contested Space — For the more adventurous players, exploring Contested Space can yield high rewards. An explorer ship can uncover many wonders and hidden treasures in this high-risk, high-reward area.</div>
                <div class="post__text">In-Game DEX — Halo’s in-game DEX allows you to trade 15 different tokenized currencies. Prices fluctuate based on player activities and supply and demand, offering numerous opportunities for profit.</div>
                <div class="post__text">Staking & Liquidity Pools — Soft staking supported external NFTs and Halo’s own Crew and Specialist NFT collections can provide passive income. Most supported external NFT collections are quite affordable, making this an accessible option for many players.</div>
                <div class="post__text">Other Halo Hacks — The smartest captains will capitalize on market Inefficiencies, spotting opportunities and inefficiencies in the various marketplaces. By capitalizing on these, you can turn a significant profit. This is a key aspect of Halo gameplay and one that rewards strategic thinking.</div>
                <div class="post__text">Don’t miss out on the earning potential of the world’s first science fiction 4X play-to-earn game!</div>

                <div class="post__text">Planet and asteroid assets are at the core of the economic simulation of Halo,  HALO. Players build buildings on the bedrock of their exotic planets to passively earn Halo, and the 14 other on-chain resources. It is the key way to maximize your income while building out your empire.</div>
                <div class="post__text">There are three different types of planets, and three different types of asteroids, with the rarest of each offering the most potential for rapid earnings. These NFTs also contain metadata about the number of buildings and the level of each building, making the more developed Planets and Asteroids rare, and more valuable on the NFT market.</div>
                <div class="post__text"><span>Planet NFTs — The Foundation of Your Empire</span></div>
                <div class="post__text">Halo explorers need at least one planet to start building out their empires but have no limitations on expanding with multiple planets and asteroids. The more of each you own, the more building structures you can have and the more passive tokens you can earn.</div>
                <div class="post__text">Planets and Asteroids come in three types: common, uncommon, and rare, with more building slots the rarer the planet is. Planets with a great number of building slots accommodate more structures which generate passive Halo tokens and the other 14 on-chain resources.</div>
                <div class="post__text">At launch there will be 2,500 common planets, 1,500 uncommon planets, and 1,000 rare planets.</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Common planets cost 0.05 ETH, and come with 10 building slots</li>
                    <li>Uncommon Planets Cost 0.07 ETH and come with 15 building slots</li>
                    <li>Rare Planets Cost 0.1 ETH and come with 20 building slots</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="post__text"><span>Supercharge Your Economy with Asteroids</span></div>
                <div class="post__text">Asteroids can be used to subsidize your growing empire, with each offering additional building slots for increasing your token economy.</div>
                <div class="post__text">At launch there will be 2,500 common asteroids, 1,500 uncommon asteroids, and 1,000 rare asteroids.</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Common asteroids cost 0.01 ETH, and come with 2 building slots</li>
                    <li>Uncommon asteroids Cost 0.02 ETH and come with 4 building slots</li>
                    <li>Rare asteroids Cost 0.03 ETH and come with 6 building slots</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="post__text"><span>Upgrading Buildings</span></div>
                <div class="post__text">In the early game, explorers must use their planet’s building slots to build and upgrade structures to start generating passive tokens. It is a reliable form of daily passive income in Halo, that can also be increased by building more buildings, and upgrading existing buildings.</div>
                <div class="post__text">Important buildings like mines, barracks, citadels, factories, refineries, and arenas all help to generate Halo and other critical resources like HLMNR, HLORE, HLNRG, and HFOOD. Later on, building Megastructures like ringworlds and dyson spheres offer 5 additional buildings to grow your galactic empire into a powerful, self-sustaining economy.</div>
                <div class="post__text"><span>Upgrade Costs & Output</span></div>
                <div class="post__text">Each building level costs 1.5x the previous level cost, with each level generating 1.5x the tokens of the previous level. Your Colony HQ is at the core of your empire and must be upgraded periodically, before you can upgrade your building levels. Building resource consumption of HLNRG and / or HFOOD also increases by 1.5x per building level.</div>
                <div class="post__text">Check out the whitepaper for more information on planet and asteroid NTFs.</div>
                <div class="post__text">Planet and Asteroid NFTs will be available for purchase in Q4 2024 when the Halo game launches. These assets are vital for the growth of your empire and your earnings. Stay tuned for updates!</div>

                <div class="post__text">Greetings Halo explorers! We are only a few months away from launch stations and we have some serious opportunities for you.</div>
                <div class="post__text">A free-to-play Telegram tapping game, and a Discord Halo RPG mini game are both launching where you can earn game tokens that will be paid out when the full Halo game launches!</div>
                <div class="post__text">We wanted to update you all on the progress of the project, and make you aware of all the exciting action that is happening in the lead-up to the main game launch.</div>
                <div class="post__text"><span>Halo Main Game Testing</span></div>
                <div class="post__text">Halo —  HALO is deep into the production stage and is on course for a December launch. The mechanics of the game are complete and our dev team has been hard at work fine tuning the game aesthetics, like buildings, and ships. Expect a game update with image and gameplay soon!</div>
                <div class="post__text">The Alpha game version is currently being tested by our devs and in a few weeks play-testing will open to the core team and a few lucky Ambassadors. Once we have received feedback and updated the game, we will make play-testing (in some form) available to a chosen few within our loyal community — Stay tuned!</div>
                <div class="post__text">In the meantime, our team is preparing a number of Halo related mini-games, and other activities so that you will all have a chance to earn Halo tokens, and other resources to use on the day the game launches.</div>
                <div class="post__text">Soon enough you will be earning real crypto and Halo tokens developing planets, undertaking missions, and exploring the cosmos of the Halo main game. Learn more about the Halo main game in the whitepaper.</div>

                <div class="post__text">We are currently fine-tuning a Telegram ‘tapper’ game that will offer Halo-themed mobile gameplay with crypto rewards and a referral system. Players can tap the home planet screen and play the 60-second falling planets game to earn gems that can be converted into Halo tokenized resources. Players can upgrade their equipment to speed up earnings:</div>
                <div class="post__text">Autominer: Upgrade autominer to earn you gems while you are offline</div>
                <div class="post__text">Power Booster: Upgrade to increase your gems per tap</div>
                <div class="post__text">Autominer Capacity: Upgrade to store more gems from autominer</div>
                <div class="post__text">Gems from the tapper game will be converted into real tokens in the main Halo game when it launches! The more gems players have, the more tokens they will earn!</div>
                <div class="post__text"><span>A Galactic RPG to Earn Halo Game Tokens</span></div>
                <div class="post__text">The Halo mini RPG is a text-based Discord game where players engage in mining activities to collect various minerals (Ores, Minerals, and Tetra). Players will also develop and upgrade their planets to earn passive income, and upgrade equipment, ships, and hire crew members to go on missions. The game features a leveling system that rewards players with XP for mining, unlocking perks as they progress.</div>
                <div class="post__text">Players can also embark on missions to earn additional rewards. The game incorporates both active gameplay through commands like /mine and passive income generation through assigned crew members.</div>
                <div class="post__text">A shop system allows players to purchase upgrades and new items using the mined resources. The ultimate goal is for players to develop planets and accumulate vast amounts of resources.</div>
                <div class="post__text">Minerals and resources earned in the free to play Discord game will be convertible to tokens in the full Halo game upon its release!</div>
                <div class="post__text">To start playing when the game launches, join the Halo discord.</div>
                <div class="post__text">Full rewards for the tapper and discord game are yet to be decided, most likely players will earn “packs” of tokens and resources in the main Halo game, depending on how many points they have earned.</div>
                <div class="post__text"><span>Live Game Trailer Watch Party</span></div>
                <div class="post__text">We are only a couple of weeks away from our second sneak peak: a AAA game intro trailer that showcases the lore behind the game, and a look into the intergalactic world of Halo.

                <div class="post__text">The first of these games is the Halo Tapper game, a Telegram-based mobile app that allows explorers to mine planets, and upgrade mining equipment with the in-game currency: gems. Players can utilize two different play functions within the app: A planet mining screen, where you tap for points, and an animated game in which players tap on falling planets — but be careful! Some planets are traps.</div>
                <div class="post__text"><span>Upgrading Equipment</span></div>
                <div class="post__text">There are three types of mining equipment that you can upgrade in the game, each with its own benefit. Players can upgrade their equipment to speed up earnings:</div>
                <div class="post__text">Autominer: The autominer mines gems for you whilst you are logged in, and even for a while after you log out. Just don’t forget to log back in, as after a while it needs maintenance and will stop generating gems.</div>
                <div class="post__text">Power Booster: Power Booster increases the gems that you get per tap on the main screen. With each upgrade, less taps and more points.</div>
                <div class="post__text">Mining Storage Limit: (Upgrade limit) Increase your gem mining storage with this feature. Just log in, and tap-to-mine. Simple.</div>
                <div class="post__text"><span>Two Ways to Earn</span></div>
                <div class="post__text">Gems from the tapper game will be converted into real tokens in-game (in the form of token resource packs) for the main Halo game when it launches. The more gems players have, the more tokens they will earn. Players can use these tokens in the main Halo game to expand your empire, develop planets, buy and upgrade buildings, construct ships, trade on DEXs, and more!</div>
                <div class="post__text"><span>Giveaways & Ambassador Program</span></div>
                <div class="post__text">In addition to the play-to-earn function, players will also be able to stack more crypto by using the games referral code system. Players can refer friends, family and other community members by referring players with their unique referral link. Tapper game referrals is not only a task in the Ambassador Program, but it will also be the focus of a 1-week referral giveaway this month, from Monday 14th to Sunday 20th.</div>

                <div class="post__text">Attention Halo Commanders! To best prepare all of you brave souls for early Halo missions, we are launching a series of space-themed mini games, with token prizes for all players. These tokens will come in the form of Halo and important resource tokens, which can be used to set up your space empires in the early game. With the Telegram Tapper game already underway and thriving with over 5,000 players in 2 weeks, we now plot a course for the Halo Discord RPG game</div>
                <div class="post__text"><span>Halo RPG Game Launches Today!</span></div>
                <div class="post__text">Launching today — the Halo mini RPG is a command-based Discord game where players engage in mining, research, and exploration activities to collect various minerals (Ore, Minerals, and Tetra). Players can develop and upgrade their planets to earn passive income — upgrade equipment, ships, and hire crew members to go on missions. The game features a leveling system that rewards players with XP for mining, unlocking perks as they progress.</div>
                <div class="post__text">The game incorporates both active gameplay through commands like /mine and passive income generation through assigned crew members. Think of the RPG as a mini version of Halo, and as such, by learning the basic gameplay elements, players set themselves up perfectly for the launch of the main game — both with tokens, and with gameplay understanding!</div>
                <div class="post__text"><span>Integrated Shop System</span></div>
                <div class="post__text">The Halo RPG uses a carefully designed shop system that allows players to purchase upgrades and new items using the mined resources. The ultimate goal is for players to develop planets and accumulate vast amounts of resources. Minerals and resources earned in the free-to-play Discord game will be convertible to tokens in the full Halo game upon its release.</div>
                <div class="post__text"><span>Token Rewards</span></div>
                <div class="post__text">All RPG players will be rewarded with real tokens, (Halo/resource tokens) when the main game is released, based on their balances in the Discord game. Just like the Tapper game, there will be a RPG leaderboard reward system, with the tiers/conversion rate to be announced at a later date!</div>
                <div class="post__text"><span>How to Play in 3 Easy Steps?</span></div>

                <div class="post__text">The great collapse of the utopian era was a major event in the history of the Halo universe. Countless brutal inter-planetary wars led to a new type of existence. A group known as the guardians developed the hyper-intelligent Halo Nexus AI to rebuild the galaxy, and manage all trade and resource distribution across the cosmos.</div>
                <div class="post__text">In this new era, developing planets, constructing facilities such as token mining buildings, and embarking on space missions are critical for all intelligent lifeforms to prosper and to reclaim what was lost. NFTs play a vital role in the Halo ecosystem, coming in the form of 3 collections: Planets and Asteroids, Crew Members and Specialists.</div>
                <div class="post__text">Planet & Asteroid NFTs</div>
                <div class="post__text">When starting out, players will need Planet or Asteroid NFTs to build structures (like a Colony HQ or different token mines) upon. These structures passively generate daily resources in the form of the game’s 15 different currencies, including Halo token. These resources are vital to growing your empire from a lowly outpost to an indomitable mega-city.</div>
                <div class="post__text">Planets and Asteroids come in three sizes: common, uncommon, and rare, with more building slots the rarer the planet is.</div>
                <div class="post__text">These NFTs also contain metadata about the number of buildings and the level of each building, making the more developed Planets and Asteroids rare, and more valuable on the NFT market. All buildings can be upgraded to level 10 and generate more tokens at each level.</div>
                <div class="post__text">Planet and Asteroids NFTs can be purchased directly from the game, or from other players on the NFT marketplace. The game will launch with 5,000 Planet NFTs and 5,000 Asteroid NFTs.</div>
                <div class="post__text"><span>Crew Member & Specialist NFTs</span></div>
                <div class="post__text">To undertake missions, your ships need to be staffed by Crew member NFTs. As a Halo explorer you can Increase your galactic reach with multiple crew members, with the rarest, “legendary” crew NFTs providing the ultimate reward levels for space missions. There will be common, uncommon, rare, and legendary crew member NFTs available with the common NFTs offering a very affordable way to boost your mission rewards.</div>

                <div class="post__text"><span>Halo Starter Pack</span></div>
                <div class="post__text">When you buy your first Planet or Asteroid NFT you will receive a free bonus pack to help start the game, this will include:</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 x Free Starter Micro Shuttle Ship NFT</li>
                    <li>1 x Free Halo Crew NFT (so you can start earning on missions)</li>
                    <li>Free Building: The Colony HQ building (so you can start earning daily token rewards from the start)</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="post__text">Halo Crew and Specialist NFTs can be soft-staked for daily token rewards. This means that you can earn rewards from your NFTs without locking them up for months at a time — and still use them in the game as normal. To achieve this, the game simply reads your wallet address to verify your NFTs, then automatically starts generating daily rewards. The game contract does not actually interact with the NFTs in any way.</div>

                <div class="post__text"><span>What is Halo?</span></div>
                <div class="post__text">Halo is a tokenized, sci-fi strategy game set in deep space, with a huge galaxy of realistic planets, asteroids, dyson spheres, ringworlds, ships, and space structures for players to fully immerse themselves in. The game offers players several key gameplay loops, including: staking, planetary development, building structures, resource generation, ship building, missions, exploration, colonization, combat, and in-game trading. Players can utilize up to 15 in-game currencies in a multitude of different ways to forge their own unique path to wealth amongst the stars.</div>
                <div class="post__text"><span>Exploring the Game</span></div>
                <div class="post__text">The more ambitious Halo explorers can engage in deep space exploration, combative gameplay in Contested Space, whilst extensively upgrading bases and other structures.</div>
                <div class="post__text">More casual players looking to earn passively can trade all of the in-game currencies, along with a multitude of in-game items, NFTs, and earn an APY from numerous staking options.</div>
                <div class="post__text">All Halo ships, resources, structures, and buildings are created by the players, and can be used to forge expansive space empires, mine exotic resources, or take on space colonization missions. Players can earn, mine, trade, or stake Halo’s 15 in-game currencies through playing the game, or using the in-game DEX.</div>
                <div class="post__text"><span>Ways To Earn</span></div>
                <div class="post__text">Halo players can choose from a multitude of way to earn, including:</div>
                <ul>

                </ul>
                <div class="post__text"><span>Tokenomics</span></div>
                <div class="post__text">The Halo team is focused on making sure there are enough resources for further development of the game over a long period of time, creating an environment for stability and steady growth for both the game and the Halo community.</div>
                <div class="post__text">For this reason, there will be no Halo token sale. Instead, 80% of the total supply is locked into the game for players to earn, through various gameplay loops. This emergent economic structure is designed to benefit active players to have a key role in deciding the fate of the game. Players who wish to progress instantly can get a boost by purchasing Halo from DEXs or in the game.</div>
                <div class="post__text"><span>Early Adopter Rewards</span></div>
                <div class="post__text">To ensure the 15 in-game currencies remain valuable, all rewards from buildings, missions, and soft staking will be gradually reduced over time. The first reward structure rebalancing will take place 90 days after launch, giving early adopters of Halo the highest rewards that will be available in the game.</div>
                <div class="post__text"><span>NFTs</span></div>
                <div class="post__text">In Halo, Planets and Asteroids are player-owned NFTs with changing metadata that reflect players’ buildings, and customization of their worlds. In addition, there are two Halo NFT collections: Crew Member NFTs, and Specialist NFTs — each offering unique benefits for missions and resource generation for their holders. Halo will also support 17 current NFT collections including Aavegotchi, Galactic Apes, Galactic Apes Genesis, Star Wolvez, and many more.</div>
                <div class="post__text">Players can buy and trade Halo NFTs on the Halo Nexus NFT Marketplace. 10% of all ETH and Matic from all sales of planets, asteroids and crew NFT’s directly from the game will be used to purchase Halo and resource tokens to provide stability to the market. Halo   will launch in Q4, 2024.</div>
